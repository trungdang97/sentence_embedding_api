# sentence_embedding_api

Requires libraries in requirement.txt.

Need to install PyTorch for CosineSimilarity and in order to use CUDA for PhoBERT inference.

API is published using Flask.

Document indexing and similarity search use Elasticsearch 7.3.1 (plugin:[vi_analyzer]).

Use <b>interface.html</b> for user interface.
